# TensorFlow_Coffee
Coffee Optimization experiment using TensorFlow to explore the parameter space and produce the essential, perfect cup of pour-over coffee.

Parameters include grind fineness, water termperature, grind mass, water mass, and added cream mass. The measured variable to optimize is a subjective measure of coffee goodness.

Experimental process:
  Put filtered water into kettle and start heating
  Place filter in V60 and rinse completely with filtered water
  Measure beans and place in grinder (do not grind)
  Once water is heated to sample temperature, do another light filter rinse to preheat V60
  Grind beans and place into filter, shaking to level
  zero scale
  Return water to sample temperature
  Set timer
  Pour 3x water to allow bloom
  Pour 5x water
  Stir, exposing all grounds
  Pour again
  Gently scrape to avoid high and dry grounds
  Swirl bed to relevel
  Finish pour
  Stop timer when water level drops below top of bed completely
  Add measured half-and-half to coffee and stir
  
Measurement:
    Breathe deeply for aroma. Sip for taste. Repeat and quantify sour/bitter scale, then overall subjective score.
